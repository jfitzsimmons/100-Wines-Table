# 100 Top Wines
I ended up using VueJS for the table.  This helped me learn Vue further.  I spent about 30 minutes getting an MVP and about an hour styling.  (I might style it further because I’m not 100% satisfied.)  The rest of the time I spent figuring out why everything was working perfectly, but Vue was screaming warnings at me.  I got all the warnings worked out though.

* The table is sortable, filterable and searchable.
* By default it is sorted by score and then winery.

* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

### Future State

* Maybe add an “info” column that is clickable and will show the note element.
* Add some more info and style to the note element.
* Maybe add some buttons to switch between a few different style / functional options
* Format the table a little better for mobile devices
* Make content in cells clickable and automatically filter rows by that content
* Find some more design inspiration from other tables online
* I might color code the scores
